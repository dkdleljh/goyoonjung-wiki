## 4) Verification / confidence levels
This wiki tracks evidence level alongside items (instead of over-claiming).

- **S/A**: Verified via official/primary sources
- **Secondary**: Only secondary sources exist (promotion candidate)
- **Needs work**: Missing proof link; date/context needs improvement

Auto-improvement flow:
- Promotion candidates are auto-scanned daily and written near the top of `news/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
- When an official proof link is found/added, items can be promoted to S/A.
